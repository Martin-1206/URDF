## URDF
# Creating URDF files and simulate them in RVIZ and GAZEBO 


* Launching RVIZ:    roslaunch urdf_rivz display.launch

* Launching Gazebo:  roslaunch urdf_gazebo robot.launch

Create a workspace first. urdf_gazebo and urdf_rviz are the ROS Noetic packages. Make sure your terminal is properly sourced.
